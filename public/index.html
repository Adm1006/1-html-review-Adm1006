<p>Thank you for visiting my website. Since my debut with the New York Philharmonic at the age of 8 I have performed with the most distinguished orchestras, conductors and accompanists internationally in a career spanning more than two decades. Highlights from my recent and upcoming seasons have included performances with North American orchestras such as the New York Philharmonic, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Philadelphia Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, Chicago Symphony, National Symphony Orchestra, Boston Symphony and Cleveland Symphony. Navigate to my Perfomance tab to make a request for my next performance. </p>
